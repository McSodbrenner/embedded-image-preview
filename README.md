If you want to try it out yourself you need a PHP capable web server.
If you already have PHP installed use the `_server/server.bat` or `_server/server.sh` to start PHPs builtin development server.
Then point your browser to one of the following URLs:

 * http://localhost:8080/example1/
 * http://localhost:8080/example2/
 * http://localhost:8080/example3/
 * http://localhost:8080/prototype/
